## Random Forest

- Random Forest is a promising machine learning model because it correctly classifies data from large data sets, is resistant to outliers, and is easy to use.
- Random Forest is a group of decision trees (a forest) that are created from identically distributed, independent random samples of data drawn with replacement from the original dataset [@breiman].
- Leo Breiman addresses poor-partitioning, noise, and long compute time with his proposal of the Random Forest model (Breiman 2001).
- An important feature of random Forest is its ability to provide measures of how strong a given variable is associated with a classification result.

## Random Forest Cont. 
- Random forest provides valuable insights into feature importance, aiding researchers in understanding which variables contribute most significantly to predictions.
- This attribute is critical in applications where identifying key factors, such as genetic markers in genome-wide association studies, environmental variables in ecological analyses, and heart failure classification is paramount.
- It is an ideal algorithm for studies that involve numerous features such as those found in the biomedical sciences. 
- Its methodology is also more easily conveyed and understood by medical professionals than many other machine learning models, allowing for greater promise in successful real-world implementation.

The <em>Gini Index</em> is referred to as a measure of node purity
[@james]. It can also be used to measure the importance of each
predictor. The Gini Index is defined by the following formula where K is
the number of classes and ${\hat{p}_{mk}}$ is the proportion of
observations in the <em>m</em>th region that are from the <em>k</em>th
class. A Gini Index of 0 represents perfect purity.

$$D=-\sum_{n=1}^{K} {\hat{p}_{mk}}(1-\hat{p}_{mk})$$

<em>Bagging</em> is the aggregation of the results from each decision
tree. It is defined by the following formula where B is the number of
training sets and $\hat{f}^{*b}$ is the prediction model. Although
bagging improves prediction accuracy, it makes interpreting the results
harder as they cannot be visualized as easily as a single decision tree
[@james].

$${\hat{f}bag(x) = 1/B \sum_{b=1}^{B}\hat{f}^{*b}(x)}$$

### Dataset Information

-   The dataset comes from the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and
    the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad Pakistan.
-   There are 299 patient records with 13 features per record.
-   Random Forest model used for predicting heart failure events for
    patients.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

Various metrics are used to assess the Random Forest model performance:

> -   Out of Bag error rate/accuracy - OOB data is data left unused by a
>     decision tree.
> -   Confusion Matrix - shows True Positive, False Positive, False
>     Negative and True Negative values to support performance
>     evaluation
> -   Precision - also known as <em>sensitivity</em> and it represents
>     how many observations labeled positive are actually positive.
> -   Recall - quantifies how many positive observations are actually
>     predicted as positive.
> -   F1 - harmonic mean of the precision and recall; assesses
>     predictive performance.
> -   Balanced accuracy - average accuracy of both true-positive and
>     true-negative classes.
> -   AUC-ROC - area under a curve created by the true positive rate vs.
>     false positive rate.

-   The testing accuracies of both models are slightly lower than their
    respective training accuracies which indicates overfitting of the
    training dataset.
-   The performance of model 2 is better than model 1. This is based off
    of the modelâ€™s training and testing accuracies; precision; F1; and
    balanced accuracy as they are all higher than those of the default
    model.

## Conclusion
- The Random Forest model is applied to a heart failure dataset of patients from Faisalabad Pakistan. 
- The Random Forest model provides strong classification results with its default settings. 
- Random Forest makes its decisions in a black box, which means we do not fully understand how is classifies data or which variables are used. 
- We do know from a review of the variable importance plot that time before follow-up visit, serum creatinine levels, and ejection fraction amount are all likely influential in the classification process.
